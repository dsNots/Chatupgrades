    <p class="scroll-text">You are a simpleton born in the small village of Thornbury. Despite your simple upbringing,
      you always felt that you were destined for something greater. One day, you found yourself waking up in a random
      alley, outside of a pub in the kingdom's main capital, Stonebridge. The afternoon had arrived, and the air was
      thick with the smell of rotten food and the sound of people busy in the streets. You opened your eyes slowly,
      fighting off what you think may be the worst hangover of your life.

      <br><br> You could not remember a
      time when you had felt so awful. To make matters worse, you couldn't remember why you were there or what you had
      done the night before. Come to think of it, you could not remember much at all. The more you thought, the less you
      remembered.
      What was your name? Where were you from? What were you doing there?
      <br><br>

      Little did you know, an epic tale had unfolded in the past weeks. You found out that you were the ancestor to
      the greatest magician to ever live. The ruthless king had discovered this when he raided the last magicians
      outpost in the kingdom, torturing and questioning its members for information on any remaining spellcasters.

      <br><br>The king wanted badly to rid of every last spellcaster so that no
      one would question his right to rule. You had barely escaped with your life, thanks to powers you had not known
      you possessed. The king took your true love hostage and held her in his fortress. You did not remember any of this
      now, unsure of how you arrived where you are.

      <br><br>
      You heard the sound of footsteps approaching from behind. You turned to see a blurry figure, your eyes still caked
      with morning gunk. The figure was carrying a loaf of bread and water, which both delighted and repulsed your
      empty, queasy stomach. You opened your eyes a bit more, trying to get a better picture of your surroundings.

      <br><br>
      In a desperate sounding tone, almost like a plea for help, you said:...
      <br><br>
      [be creative with your answers or the game
      will crash before you defeat the king, responses can in the form of dialogue or explanations of actions you take,
      garbage in = garbage out]
